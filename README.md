# 💻 WP Starter Theme

This is the WordPress starter theme developed to improve themes development process. The main reason to do this theme was make ability to start not from scratch but from that point of the project, what really matters. It's not necessary to invent the wheel every time. 

Just start the right things! 🎉

## What's inside?

* This theme uses ParcelJS as their bundler
* SCSS (with atomic-design oriented structure)
* Bootstrap v4 grid `(optional, you can disable it in ./src/css/01-vendors/_vendors.import.scss)`
* Vanilla JavaScript with ES6 enabled features (Babel inside) such as ... (complete)

## What's in functions.php?

* Support for posts thumbnails
* Disabled Gutenberg (I think it's necessary until Gutenberg it's *really* stable)
