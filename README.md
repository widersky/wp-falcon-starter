# 🛫 WP Starter Theme

This is the WordPress starter theme developed to improve themes development process. The main reason to do this theme was make ability to start not from scratch but from that point of the project, what really matters. It's not necessary to invent the wheel every time. 

Just start the right things! 🎉

## What's inside?

* This theme uses WebPack as their bundler
* SCSS `(with atomic-design oriented structure)`
* Simple SCSS Framework based on Flexbox model
* Vanilla JavaScript (Babel inside)

## What's **not** inside?

* jQuery, use damn modern pure JS instead 😉

## What's in functions.php?

* Support for posts thumbnails
* Custom function for responsive images (srcset generation)
* Stupidly simple function to view PHP objects nicely
* Disabled Gutenberg `(I think it's necessary until Gutenberg it's *really* stable)`
* For safety there is WP version and errors on login page removed
* Disabled whole wp-head crap (Emojis, Gutenberg blocks CSS, REST API etc.)
* Custom thumbnail sizes (most popular sizes included)
* Enabled possibility to upload SVG files to media library

## How to

🛫 Start: `npm install`

🛠 Develop: `npm run start` \
👷‍ Build: `npm run build`

> You need to run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` task to make theme usable in browser (there are two `./*/dist/` folders disabled from repository)
